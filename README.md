<h2 align="left">🎯 About the project</h2>

###

<p align="left">
This project was created as a learning exercise based on a boss battle scenario from <i>C# Player’s Guide</i>.
The goal was to practice core programming concepts such as control flow, methods, input validation, and game state handling.
<br><br>
The game is a console-based, turn-based experience where one player secretly places the Manticore,
and the other player must defend the city of Consolas by calculating the correct cannon range.
<br><br>
This project is actively being developed and will continue to evolve with new features, improvements,
and refactoring as my skills grow.

<h2 align="left">💻 Technical notes</h2>

###

<p align="left">
• Built with C# (.NET)<br>
• Console application<br>
• Procedural structure with clear method separation<br>
• Loops, conditionals, and modular methods<br>
